## Prioritized Backlog
### P0 (Critical)
- [x] Form Submissions Management ✅ (Feb 23, 2026)
- [x] Notification Dropdown Readability Fix ✅ (Feb 23, 2026)
  - Fixed CSS inheritance issue causing white text on white background
  - Added targeted CSS selectors to override inherited dashboard-header styles
  - Notification messages, timestamps, and badges now clearly visible
- [ ] Refactoring backend/frontend (server.py 2000+ lines, AdminDashboard.jsx 2500+ lines)

### P1 (High Priority)
- Add Resend API key for email notifications to work in production
- Deploy the application
- Employee schedule/shift management

### P2 (Medium Priority)
- Export hours to CSV/PDF
- Multi-location support
- Inventory integration with platforms

## Next Tasks
1. **Refactor backend/server.py** - Break into modular structure (routers, models, services)
2. **Refactor AdminDashboard.jsx** - Decompose into smaller components
3. Deploy the application
4. Configure Resend API key for production email notifications

## Testing Status
- Backend: 100% pass (93 tests + 16 form submission tests)
- Frontend: 100% pass (12 form submission tests)
- Test reports: `/app/test_reports/`
- Test files: `/app/backend/tests/`

## Recent Updates (Feb 23, 2026)
- **Form Submissions UI**: Added admin interface to view and manage all form submissions
  - Collapsible section at bottom of Admin Dashboard
  - Three tabs for different form types
  - View details modal with status update buttons
  - Delete functionality with confirmation
  - 100% test coverage (backend and frontend)

## Notes
- Email notifications are configured but require a valid Resend API key (currently placeholder)
- PDF generation uses reportlab library
- Individual employee rates shown with ★ indicator in payroll reports
- Minor React hydration warning in console (cosmetic, does not affect functionality)
- **REFACTORING NEEDED**: server.py and AdminDashboard.jsx are monolithic files that need to be broken down
